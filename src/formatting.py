The internal representation of formatted text is much like an s-expression.

They are specified as follows:
            [directive: this is the body of text to apply it to]

The colon and the space following are important! The first space is not part
of the body, but any trailing spaces after it or at the end of the body are
included in the output.

Escaping via backslash is supported. Nesting is supported as well, but escaping
the delimiters is a bit tricky when nesting (both ends need to be escaped).
See the following examples:

[bold: this here \] is totally valid, and so is [<-TOTALLY OK this]
[bold: \[red: but both]<-CHOKE delimiters within a nest must be escaped.]

Directives are only parsed whenever the directive name is defined, and the
colon/space follow it. Thus, including [brackets like this] in a post body
will NOT require you to escape it! Even [brackets: like this] is safe, because
brackets is not a defined formatting parameter. So, any amount of unescaped brackets
may exist within the body unless they mimic a directive. To escape a valid directive,
escaping only the opening is suffiecient: \[bold: like this]. The literal body of
text outputted by that will be [bold: like this], with the backslash removed.

Just like the brackets themselves, backslashes may occur freely within bodies,
they are only removed when they occur before a valid expression.
