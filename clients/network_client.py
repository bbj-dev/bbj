    # this module isn't exactly complete. The below description claims
    # `all of its endpoints are mapped to native methods` though this
    # is not yet true. The documentation for the API is not yet
    # complete, and neither is this client. Currently, this module is

    """
    A python implementation to the BBJ api: all of its endpoints are
    mapped to native methods, it maps error responses to exceptions, and
    it includes helper functions for several common patterns.

    It should be noted that endpoints utilizing usermaps are returned as
    tuples, where [0] is the value and [1] is the usermap dictionary.
    Methods who do this will mention it in their documentation.
    You can call them like `threads, usermap = bbj.thread_index()`

    __init__ can take a host string and a port value (which can be
    either int or str). It defaults to "127.0.0.1" and 7099, expanding
    out to http://127.0.0.1:7099/.

    Standard library exceptions are used, but several new attributes are
    attached to them before raising: .code, .description, and .body.
    code and description map the same values returned by the api. body
    is the raw error object. Classes are mapped as follows:

      0, 1, 2: ChildProcessError
      3: ValueError
      4: UserWarning
      5: ConnectionRefusedError

    attributes can be accessed as follows:

    try:
        response = bbj.endpoint():
    except UserWarning as e:
        assert e.code == 4
        print(e.description)
        # want the raw error object? that's weird, but whatever.
        return e.body

    See the official API error documentation for more details.
    """

        Important attributes:
          .base is a string url for which all requests go to. It is
          constructed on instantiation and the standalone host/port
          are not stored.

          .user_{name,auth} can be None, or strings of the username
          and the authorization hash, respectively. When both values
          are present (ie both resolve to True in a boolean context),
          the request method sends this info with all its requests
          and the user is effectively "logged in".

          .send_auth, defaulting to True, determines whether to send
          authorization information when it is available (see above).
          If you set this to False, anonymous network usage is
          guaranteed.
